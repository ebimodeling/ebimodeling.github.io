### Expectations

*  Schedules:
  *  Provide planned work schedules, including any known vacations /
        absences.
  * In office during normal working hours
  * Give supervisor a minimum of 24 hour notice for any unexpected
        absences (rare exceptions).
*  Skills: After the first week, you will be expected to know 
  * Location of contents in the PEcAn wiki
  * How to edit the wiki
  * How to create, respond to, and resolve issues.
  * How to use git version control (at minimum: you should have a
        Github/Bitbucket fork and a local copy of source code for the
        project you are working on).
*  Working environment 
  * Dress appropriately
  * Be nice
  * Ask Questions

### Best Practices Overview

The first required reading for all is [“Best Practices for Scientific
Computing” by White et al
2014](http://www.plosbiology.org/article/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pbio.1001745).

*  Write programs for people, not computers
  * Consistent Style, meaningful variable names
*  Let the computer do the work
  * Automated builds, workflows
*  Make incremental changes:
  * Commit frequently.
  * everything written (created manually) goes in version control
*  Don’t repeat yourself
  * modular code
  * reuse or refactor code instead of re-writing it: don’t re-invent
        the wheel. Before writing a new function, ask “is there an
        existing package/ gem/ library that already does this?
*  plan for mistakes
  * add assertions
  * write tests (and examples)
  * these are important for collaborative coding
*  Document design and purpose, not mechanics
  * Use vignettes (R), tests, and examples for documentation
  * vignettes> publications (and vice-versa)
*  collaborate
  * Ask each other questions. Review each other’s code.
  * Most technical questions should be asked either as an issue in
        Redmine, Github, Bitbucket. If a generic programming question,
        Stackexchange is very useful.

### Project-Specific

Everyone will need to use GitHub for project-specific bug and feature tracking (there
will be overlap). In addition to reading the wikis listed below, you
should familiarize yourself with using git and markdown. Update wikis
with incorrect information.

*  The ‘go to’ place for general, cross-project protocols is the [PEcAn
    wiki](https://github.com/PecanProject/pecan/wiki) on GitHub.
  * [using
        Git](https://github.com/PecanProject/pecan/wiki/Using-Git)
  * [reporting bugs and requesting
        features](https://github.com/PecanProject/pecan/wiki/Github-issues)
  * [installing a build
        environment](https://github.com/PecanProject/pecan/wiki/Installing-PEcAn#install-build-environment)
  * [R coding
        style](https://github.com/PecanProject/pecan/wiki/Coding-style)
        for anyone working on PEcAn or BioCro (which are largely
        implemented in R).
*  BETYdb wiki:
    [https://github.com/PecanProject/bety/wiki](https://github.com/PecanProject/bety/wiki)
   
  * This wiki is specific to the Ruby-on-Rails interface
*  Other projects (BioCro)
  * Writing should be aimed at documentation and publication
